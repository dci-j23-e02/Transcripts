### Technical Terms Explained
- **RESTful API**: Representational State Transfer API, a web service that adheres to REST principles.
- **Annotations**: Metadata added to Java code to provide additional information to the compiler.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: A model where the client requests services and the server provides them.
- **Caching**: Storing data temporarily to reduce the need for repeated requests.
- **Uniform Interface**: Standardized methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) used in RESTful APIs.
- **Layered System**: Dividing an application into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access).

### Summary
The meeting focused on implementing a password reset feature and integrating a currency converter API into the system. The live coding session demonstrated how to connect to an external API and implement role-based access control using Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA, and Hibernate. The importance of validation dependencies and RESTful API principles was discussed. Upcoming events and career fairs were also announced.

### Questions to Expand Understanding

1. **What is the purpose of the password reset feature?**
   - The password reset feature allows users to reset their passwords by answering security questions, ensuring that only the legitimate user can perform the reset.

2. **How does role-based access control work in this system?**
   - Role-based access control restricts access to certain features based on the user's role (e.g., admin, user). Specific endpoints are accessible only to users with the appropriate role.

3. **What are the key dependencies required for this implementation?**
   - Key dependencies include Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA, Hibernate, and validation libraries.

4. **What are the main principles of RESTful APIs?**
   - The main principles include statelessness, client-server architecture, caching, uniform interface, and layered system.

5. **How does the `@ElementCollection` annotation work?**
   - The `@ElementCollection` annotation is used to define a collection of basic types (e.g., strings) associated with an entity. It helps in mapping collections in JPA.

6. **What is the significance of the `restTemplate` in Spring?**
   - The `restTemplate` is a synchronous client used to perform HTTP requests, simplifying communication with external APIs.

### Live Coding Example

```java
@Service
public class CurrencyConverterService {

    @Value("${rate.api.key}")
    private String apiKey;

    private final RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

    public CurrencyConverterService() {
        // Constructor
    }

    public ConversionResponse convertCurrency(String from, String to, double amount) {
        String url = String.format("https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/%s?apikey=%s", from, apiKey);
        ResponseEntity<ConversionResponse> response = restTemplate.getForEntity(url, ConversionResponse.class);
        ConversionResponse conversionResponse = response.getBody();
        if (conversionResponse != null) {
            double rate = conversionResponse.getRates().get(to);
            double convertedAmount = rate * amount;
            return new ConversionResponse(from, to, rate, amount, convertedAmount);
        }
        throw new RuntimeException("Failed to convert currency");
    }
}
```

### Extra Explanation

- **RestTemplate**: A synchronous client to perform HTTP requests. It simplifies the communication with external APIs by providing methods like `getForEntity`, `postForEntity`, etc.
- **@Value**: Annotation used to inject values from properties files into fields in Spring-managed beans.
- **ResponseEntity**: Represents the entire HTTP response, including status code, headers, and body. It is used to handle responses from RESTful web services.

By following these principles and using the provided code example, you can effectively integrate external APIs and implement role-based access control in your Spring Boot application.
