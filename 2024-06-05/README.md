## Transcript

### Introduction
**Terissa Gwendjo:** Good morning, Safwan.

**Safwan Kh:** Good morning, everyone. Let's get started.

### Recap and Announcements
**Safwan Kh:** Security is a very important topic. We are using Spring Security for authentication and authorization. We will continue from where we left off yesterday. Today, we will focus on implementing the logout functionality and, if time permits, we will also cover relationships between tables.

### Review of Current State
**Safwan Kh:** Let's review what we have done so far. We have added a `User` entity, a `UserRepository`, and a `UserService` implementation. We have also configured Spring Security.

### Security Configuration
**Safwan Kh:** In the `SecurityConfig` class, we have enabled web security and configured the security filter chain. We have allowed public access to the sign-up and login endpoints. We have also configured form-based login and logout.

### User Service Implementation
**Safwan Kh:** The `UserService` implementation handles user registration and password encoding. We have also implemented the `UserDetailsService` interface to load user details for authentication.

### Controller
**Safwan Kh:** In the `UserController`, we handle the sign-up and login endpoints. We have added error messages for invalid credentials.

### Debugging Logout Functionality
**Safwan Kh:** Let's run the application and see how it works. We need to ensure that the logout functionality works correctly. Currently, clicking the logout button does not log the user out properly.

### Implementing Logout
**Safwan Kh:** We need to update the security configuration to handle the logout URL correctly. We will also update the controller to handle the logout success URL.

### Lunch Break
**Safwan Kh:** Let's take a lunch break and come back to debug the logout issue.

### Post-Lunch Debugging
**Safwan Kh:** Welcome back. I found the solution for the logout issue. We don't need to implement it manually. I missed some configurations in the security config and the controller.

### Security Configuration Updates
**Safwan Kh:** In the `SecurityConfig` class, we need to ensure that the logout URL is handled correctly. We also need to invalidate the HTTP session and delete cookies.

### Controller Updates
**Safwan Kh:** In the `UserController`, we need to handle the logout success URL. We will redirect to the login page with a logout parameter.

### Testing Logout Functionality
**Safwan Kh:** Let's run the application and test the logout functionality. It should now log the user out correctly and delete the session cookies.

### Task for Students
**Safwan Kh:** Your task is to add the login, sign-up, and logout functionality to the expense tracker application. The code is up to date on GitHub, so you can refer to it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in breakout rooms.

### Conclusion
**Safwan Kh:** Tomorrow, we will cover relationships between tables. Each user can have multiple accounts, but each account can have only one user. Have a nice rest of the day, and see you tomorrow.
