#### Improved Coding Style for Role Assignment Logic

```java
// UserService.java
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Autowired
    private RoleRepository roleRepository;

    public void saveUser(User user) {
        user.setPassword(passwordEncoder.encode(user.getPassword()));
        Set<Role> roles = new HashSet<>();
        Role userRole = roleRepository.findByName("ROLE_USER");
        if (userRole == null) {
            userRole = new Role("ROLE_USER");
            roleRepository.save(userRole);
        }
        roles.add(userRole);
        user.setRoles(roles);
        userRepository.save(user);
        userRole.addUser(user); // Ensure bidirectional relationship
    }

    public void updateUserRoles(User user) {
        userRepository.save(user);
    }
}

// UserController.java
@Controller
public class UserController {

    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;

    @Autowired
    private RoleRepository roleRepository;

    @PostMapping("/assignAdmin")
    public String assignAdmin(@RequestParam String username, Model model) {
        User user = userService.findByUsername(username);
        if (user != null) {
            Role adminRole = roleRepository.findByName("ROLE_ADMIN");
            if (adminRole == null) {
                adminRole = new Role("ROLE_ADMIN");
                roleRepository.save(adminRole);
            }
            user.getRoles().add(adminRole);
            adminRole.addUser(user); // Ensure bidirectional relationship
            userService.updateUserRoles(user);
            model.addAttribute("message", "Admin role assigned successfully");
        } else {
            model.addAttribute("error", "User not found");
        }
        return "redirect:/";
