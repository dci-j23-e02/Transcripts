## Java Class Transcript Summary (2024-06-12)

### Concepts Taught and Explanations

1. **Live Coding for API Module**:
   - **Expense Tracker Application**: Continued development of the expense tracker application, focusing on implementing the remaining service methods and starting the security configuration.
   - **Service Layer**: Implementation of additional methods in `ExpenseService` for updating and deleting expenses based on various criteria.
   - **Controller Layer**: Discussion on the structure and responsibilities of controllers, including the creation of a `HomeController` for handling the home page.

2. **Transactional Management**:
   - **Transactional Annotation**: Emphasis on using `@Transactional` in the service layer for methods that modify data, ensuring data integrity and rollback mechanisms.

3. **Spring Security**:
   - **Security Configuration**: Creation of a `SecurityConfig` class to handle security settings, including user authentication, authorization, and session management.
   - **UserDetailsService**: Explanation of the importance of implementing `UserDetailsService` for custom user authentication.
   - **Security Filters**: Configuration of security filters for handling login, logout, and access control to specific endpoints.

4. **Dependency Injection**:
   - **Autowired Annotation**: Detailed discussion on how `@Autowired` works and the importance of annotating classes with `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Bean` to ensure they are recognized as beans in the Spring container.

5. **Form Handling with Thymeleaf**:
   - **Model Attribute**: Use of `Model` to pass an empty user object to the sign-up form, which will be populated with user input.

### Questions and Answers

1. **Question**: Why do we need to use `@Transactional` in the service layer?
   - **Answer**: Using `@Transactional` in the service layer ensures that multiple repository operations are managed within a single transaction, providing better transaction management and data integrity.

2. **Question**: Why don't we need a `@PostMapping` for login?
   - **Answer**: The authentication process is handled by Spring Security, which automatically processes the login form submission. Therefore, a `@PostMapping` is not required in the controller.

3. **Question**: What is the difference between `@Transactional` from Spring and Jakarta?
   - **Answer**: The Jakarta `@Transactional` is used in Java EE environments and is more suitable for the service layer, while the Spring `@Transactional` is more compatible with Spring features like Spring Data JPA and is typically used in the repository layer.

4. **Question**: Why do we use `UserDetailsService`?
   - **Answer**: `UserDetailsService` is a core component in Spring Security used to retrieve user-related data securely, primarily for authentication purposes.

5. **Question**: How does Spring recognize a class as a bean?
   - **Answer**: Spring recognizes a class as a bean if it is annotated with `@Service`, `@Repository`, or `@Bean`. These annotations ensure that instances of the class are added to the Spring container and can be injected as dependencies using `@Autowired`.

### Live Coding Examples

1. **ExpenseService**:
   ```java
   @Service
   public class ExpenseService {
       @Autowired
       private ExpenseRepository expenseRepository;

       @Transactional
       public Expense saveExpense(Expense expense) {
           if (expense == null) {
               throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid expense object");
           }
           return expenseRepository.save(expense);
       }

       public List<Expense> findAllExpenses() {
           return expenseRepository.findAll();
       }

       @Transactional
       public void updateExpenseAmount(double amount, Long id) {
           expenseRepository.updateExpenseAmount(amount, id);
       }

       @Transactional
       public void deleteExpenseByCategory(String category) {
           expenseRepository.deleteExpenseByCategory(category);
       }

       @Transactional
       public void updateExpenseDescription(String description, Long id) {
           expenseRepository.updateExpenseDescription(description, id);
       }

       @Transactional
       public void updateExpenseCategory(String category, Long id) {
           expenseRepository.updateExpenseCategory(category, id);
       }

       @Transactional
       public void deleteExpenseByDateRange(LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate) {
           expenseRepository.deleteExpenseByDateRange(startDate, endDate);
       }

       @Transactional
       public void updateExpenseDate(LocalDate date, Long id) {
           expenseRepository.updateExpenseDate(date, id);
       }

       @Transactional
       public void deleteExpenseByUser(Long userId) {
           expenseRepository.deleteExpenseByUser(userId);
       }

       @Transactional
       public void updateExpenseUser(User user, Long id) {
           expenseRepository.updateExpenseUser(user, id);
       }

       @Transactional
       public void updateMultipleExpenses(double amount, List<Long> ids) {
           expenseRepository.updateMultipleExpenses(amount, ids);
       }

       @Transactional
       public void deleteExpenseById(Long id) {
           expenseRepository.deleteExpenseById(id);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **SecurityConfig**:
   ```java
   @Configuration
   @EnableWebSecurity
   public class SecurityConfig {
       @Bean
       public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
           return new UserService();
       }

       @Bean
       public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
           http
               .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                   .requestMatchers("/signup", "/login").permitAll()
                   .anyRequest().authenticated()
               )
               .formLogin(form -> form
                   .loginPage("/login")
                   .defaultSuccessUrl("/home", true)
                   .permitAll()
               )
               .logout(logout -> logout
                   .logoutUrl("/logout")
                   .logoutSuccessUrl("/login?logout")
                   .permitAll()
               );
           return http.build();
       }

       @Autowired
       public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth, UserDetailsService userDetailsService, PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder) throws Exception {
           auth.userDetailsService(userDetailsService).passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder);
       }
   }
   ```
